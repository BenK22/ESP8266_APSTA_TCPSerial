# ESP8266_APSTA_TCPSerial

This project was to test the capabilites of using ChatGPT as an assitant for coding something I'm somewhat inexperienced in and because I couldn't find a F/W for the ESP8266 that did exactly what I wanted.

Arduino F/W for the ESP8266, starts up in AP, allows you to connect to a network, and provides a Serial-to-TCP Client connection.  All browser configurable.
